# Day 01 — Variables & Basic JavaScript

Welcome to **Day 01** of my 30-day JavaScript & UI journey!  
Today’s focus is on learning and practicing the **core basics of JavaScript**, including variables, data types, user input, simple logic, and DOM manipulation.

This day includes **3 mini projects**, each helping reinforce the fundamentals.

---

## 🎯 Today's Topic: Variables & Basic JS

In this lesson, I practiced the essential building blocks of JavaScript:

### ✔️ Variables
- `let`, `const`
- Storing numbers and strings

### ✔️ Basic Data Types
- Number  
- String  
- Boolean (in validations)

### ✔️ Basic DOM Manipulation
- Selecting elements using `document.getElementById`
- Reading values from input fields
- Updating text on the page using `.textContent`

### ✔️ Simple Logic & Conditionals
- `if` / `else` structures
- Comparing values (e.g., checking valid day/month/year)
- Preventing invalid inputs

### ✔️ Basic Math Operations
- Subtraction for age calculation
- Converting string inputs to numbers with `Number()`

These fundamentals will be used every day in the next 30 days.

# 🧮 Project 1 — Age Calculator (DD / MM / YYYY)

This project takes the user’s **day, month, and year** of birth and calculates their age in **years**, using basic JavaScript logic.

### 🔍 What I Practiced
- Variables (`const`, `let`)
- Getting input values
- Converting values using `Number()`
- Simple date validation
- Using `new Date()` to compare dates
- Outputting results to the screen
- `addEventListener("click")` usage

### 📦 Features
- Enter birth date as DD / MM / YYYY
- Validates:
  - Day (1–31)
  - Month (1–12)
  - Year (≥ 1900)
  - Future dates prevented
  - Invalid dates blocked
- Clean and modern blue UI
- Fully responsive

### 📁 Files Included
- [`index.html`](./projects/project01/index.html)
- [`style.css`](./projects/project01/style.css)
- [`script.js`](./projects/project01/script.js)

### 🔗 Live Demo

# 📝 Project 3 — Coming Soon

## ✨ Project 3 Title  
(Will be added after the Day 01 third project is completed.)

### 🔍 What it will include
- Basic event handling  
- Simple computations  
- Practicing inputs and outputs  
- Small but functional JS logic

## 📚 Summary of What I Learned Today

- How to declare and use JS variables  
- How to take input from the user  
- How to update the UI with JavaScript  
- How conditionals work  
- How simple math + logic build a real project  
- How to validate user input  
- Introduction to working with the Date object

## 🚀 End of Day 01

Day 1 is complete!  
I built one functional project and prepared for the next two.  
Tomorrow, I move to more dynamic JS and UI interactions.
