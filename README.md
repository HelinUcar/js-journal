# 📓 js-journal – My 30-Day JavaScript Journey

Welcome to my personal JavaScript learning journey!  
Over the course of **30 days**, I'm building **30+ mini projects** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — one step at a time, one project a day.

This challenge is designed to help me learn JavaScript by building real, functional, and sometimes fun things every single day.

Each day has **one main theme** and **three mini projects**.

## 🔍 What I'm Practicing

### 🟦 Core Web Fundamentals
- Mastering **HTML structure**, semantic elements, and layout building  
- Strengthening **CSS fundamentals**, positioning, spacing & responsive design  
- Building clean, organized, and scalable **JavaScript fundamentals**

### 🟨 DOM & UI Interactions
- Selecting, modifying, and creating DOM elements dynamically  
- Handling events such as **click**, **keyup**, **mouseover**, **scroll**, **drag events**  
- Updating UI based on user interactions  
- Building dynamic components (modals, tabs, accordions, counters, timers)

### 🟩 Component-Based Thinking
- Designing reusable UI elements such as:  
  - Buttons  
  - Cards  
  - Forms  
  - Badges & Tags  
  - Navigation bars  
  - Toasts, tooltips, modals  
  - Custom input elements  
- Structuring projects like a mini front-end component library

### 🟪 Responsive & User-Friendly Interfaces
- Designing layouts that adapt to different screen sizes (~mobile-first approach)  
- Ensuring visual hierarchy, spacing, typography & accessibility  
- Creating interactive and intuitive components (dropdowns, accordions, sliders)

### 🟥 Data Handling & Logic
- Using arrays, objects, loops, conditionals & functions to solve problems  
- Filtering, sorting, mapping & transforming data (search engines + list filtering)  
- Form validation, error handling & sanitizing input  

### 🟧 Asynchronous JavaScript
- Using **Promises**, **then/catch**, and **async/await**  
- Understanding async flow through timers, API requests & UI updates  
- Making GET requests to external APIs (RandomUser, RESTCountries, Dog API, etc.)

### 🟫 Web APIs
- Working with:  
  - **Fetch API** (JSON requests, status handling, async rendering)  
  - **LocalStorage** (saving theme, notes, tasks, user preferences)  
  - **SessionStorage**  
  - **Browser Events API** (keyboard, mouse, scroll events)  
- Creating data-driven UI components

### 🟩 Micro-App Development
- Calculator, password generator, unit converter  
- Notes app, shopping list, expense tracker  
- Timers, countdown apps, Pomodoro  
- Dashboards, charts (CSS-based), analytics cards

### 🟦 State Management (Vanilla JS)
- Managing UI state in components (opened/closed modals, toggles, tabs)  
- Handling user input states & derived UI states  
- Building apps with multi-step flows (multi-step form, wizard-like interactions)

### 🔵 Project Structure & Clean Code
- Organizing each project with **index.html**, **style.css**, **script.js**  
- Writing readable, maintainable JavaScript  
- Using clear naming conventions & modular thinking

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen core JavaScript skills  
- Improve problem-solving through practice  
- Build a strong foundation for real-world apps  
- Create a portfolio of projects
