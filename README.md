# 📓 js-journal – My 30-Day JavaScript Journey

Welcome to my personal JavaScript learning journey!  
Over the course of **30 days**, I'm building **30+ mini projects** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — one step at a time, one project a day.

This challenge is designed to help me learn JavaScript by building real, functional, and sometimes fun things every single day.
